# How to contribute

## Dependencies

We use `poetry` to manage the [dependencies](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).
If you dont have `poetry`, you should install with `make poetry-download`.

To install dependencies and prepare [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks you would need to run `install` command:

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

To activate your `virtualenv` run `poetry shell`.

## Codestyle

After installation you may execute code formatting.

```bash
make codestyle
```

### Checks

Many checks are configured for this project. Command `make check-codestyle` will check black and isort.
The `make check-typing` command will run mypy to check for typing issues. 

Comand `make lint` applies both checks above.

The `make check-safety` command will look at the security of your code. 

### Before submitting

Before submitting your code please do the following steps:

1. Add any changes you want
1. Add tests for the new changes
1. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
1. Run `make codestyle` to format your changes.
1. Run `make lint` to ensure that types, security and docstrings are okay.

## Makefile reference

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/RafaelWO/unparallel/blob/main/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort` and `black` library

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make check-typing
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make check-codestyle && make check-typing
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```
