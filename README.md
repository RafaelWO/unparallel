With Unparallel you can easily create thousands of web requests in an efficient way leveraging Python's async capabilities.

Unparallel is built on top of [HTTPX](https://github.com/encode/httpx/) and aims to support its rich set of features.

## Installation

```bash
pip install unparallel
```

## Example
A simple example of doing several GET requests to an HTTP web service:

```python
import asyncio
from unparallel import up

async def main():
    url = "https://httpbin.org"
    paths = [f"/get?i={i}" for i in range(5)]
    results = await up(url, paths)
    print([item["args"] for item in results])

asyncio.run(main())
```

This prints:
```
Making async requests: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 5/5 [00:00<00:00,  9.98it/s]
[{'i': '0'}, {'i': '1'}, {'i': '2'}, {'i': '3'}, {'i': '4'}]
```


Similarly, we can do a bunch of POST requests. This time we will use a single path but multiple payloads:

```python
import asyncio
from unparallel import up

async def main():
    url = "https://httpbin.org"
    path = "/post"
    payloads = [{"obj_id": i} for i in range(5)]
    results = await up(url, path, method="post", payloads=payloads)
    print([item["data"] for item in results])

asyncio.run(main())
```

This prints:
```
Making async requests: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 5/5 [00:00<00:00,  9.98it/s]
['{"obj_id": 0}', '{"obj_id": 1}', '{"obj_id": 2}', '{"obj_id": 3}', '{"obj_id": 4}']
```

For more details on the usage and examples, check out the [docs][docs-usage].

## Why unparallel? Why async?
Async is a really powerful feature - especially when you have to wait for I/O.
Here is an example of making 20 web requests synchronously vs. asynchronously via `unparallel`.

As you can see, the async version finishes in less than a second.

<details><summary>Code for sync</summary>

```python
import httpx
from tqdm import tqdm


def main():
    url = "https://httpbin.org"
    paths = [f"/get?i={i}" for i in range(20)]
    results = [
        httpx.get(f"{url}{path}") for path in tqdm(paths, desc="Making sync requests")
    ]
    assert len(results) == 20


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

</details>

<details><summary>Code for async</summary>

```python
import asyncio

from unparallel import up


async def main():
    url = "https://httpbin.org"
    paths = [f"/get?i={i}" for i in range(20)]

    results = await up(url, paths)

    assert len(results) == 20


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
