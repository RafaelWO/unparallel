You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/RafaelWO/unparallel/releases) page.

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

We use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you’re ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.

### List of labels and corresponding titles

You can update it in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/RafaelWO/unparallel/blob/main/.github/release-drafter.yml).

GitHub creates the `bug`, `enhancement`, and `question` labels for you (based on issue templates). Create the remaining labels on the Issues tab of your GitHub repository, when you need them.
